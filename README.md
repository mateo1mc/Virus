# Spiral Art with Turtle

This Python script uses the turtle module to create a mesmerizing spiral pattern. The turtle moves in a loop, drawing lines in red on a black background to form a spiral shape.

## Instructions

Requirements:
- Python installed
- turtle module

Setup:
- Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
- The script uses the turtle module, which is a standard Python library and should be available by default.

Usage:
- Run the Python script.
- A window will appear displaying the turtle drawing a red spiral on a black background.
- The spiral pattern is formed by the turtle's movement - turning left and moving forward with decreasing lengths.

Execution:
- Execute the script in a Python environment:
```bash
python virus.py
```

## Output

- A visual representation of a red spiral on a black background will be displayed in a window.
